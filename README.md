# TTL_TicTacToe
I quickly knocked this Logisim version of TTT upin preparation for designing a real circuit with TTL components. Quick comments on the circuit layout. Buttons 1 to 9 for the user are on the left running top to bottom. Then top to bottom are the LEDs to show user's moves 1 to 9. On the right are the LEDs for the board's moves, top to bottom 1 to 9. Down the bottom right are the "draw" and "board wins" LEDs.
Sorry I didn't have time to lay the buttons and LEDs out in a square grid!
