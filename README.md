# TTL_TicTacToe
I quickly knocked this Logisim version of TTT upin preparation for designing a real circuit with TTL components. Quick comments on the circuit layout. Buttons 1 to 9 for the user are on the left running top to bottom. Then top to bottom are the LEDs to show user's moves 1 to 9. On the right are the LEDs for the board's moves, top to bottom 1 to 9. Down the bottom right are the "draw" and "board wins" LEDs.
Sorry I didn't have time to lay the buttons and LEDs out in a square grid!

If you haven't used Logisim before, open up the _*.circ_ file. Right-click on the ROM and choose *Load image* and choose the _ttl.rom_ file to load. Now start the clock with a control-K (or use _Simulate -> Ticks Enabled_). Now that the circuit is running, click on the brown finger icon (the poke tool) at the top-left. Use this to push the nine user move buttons and/or the Reset button. The buttons are the slightly 3D-looking white squares.
